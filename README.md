Http-Cache-Control
------------------

A tiny lib which provides documented constants and example use-cases for the HTTP `Cache-Control` header, based on the [official cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/about/cache-control/).

Sending proper Cache-Control headers is essential to each web-application, but the required keywords are sometimes misleading and ambiguous. 
This library aims to provide a more reliable and consistent way to set the Cache-Control header.
